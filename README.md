# Restaurant

A restaurant page made with JavaScript and webpack. This project showcases
webpack usage capabilities for frontend projects, especially the handling of
different file formats to create a single JavaScript file (the bundle in terms
of webpack). As a matter of context this is a website for promoting an
hipothetical restaurant, The page even has ficticios characters and a utterly
made up history.
